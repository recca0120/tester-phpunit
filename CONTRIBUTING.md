# Contributing

## Basic Steps

If you would like to contribute enhancements or fixes, please do the following:

1.  Fork the package repository
2.  Run `npm install` to setup all dependencies
3.  Hack on a separate topic branch created from the latest `master`. Changes to
    the package code should be made to the files in the `lib` directory.
4.  Check for lint errors with `npm test`.
5.  Commit the changes under `lib` and push the topic branch
6.  Make a pull request

## Guidelines

Please note that modifications should follow these coding guidelines:

*   Indent is 2 spaces
*   Code should pass the `eslint` linter
*   Vertical whitespace helps readability, donâ€™t be afraid to use it

## Releasing

Project members with push access to the repository also have the permissions
needed to release a new version.  If there have been changes to the project and
the team decides it is time for a new release, the process is to:

1. Update `CHANGELOG.md` with the planned version number and a short bulleted
list of major changes.  Include pull request numbers if applicable.
2. Commit the changelog and any `lib/` changes to master.
3. Publish a new version with `apm publish {major|minor|patch}`, using semver to
decide what type of version should be released.
4. `apm` will then automatically:
  * Update `package.json` with the new version number
  * Commit the changed `package.json` to master
  * Create a git tag for the new version and push it to GitHub
  * Publish the package to the Atom package manager

Thank you for helping out!
